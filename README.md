# wordle

Uses [wordle-python](https://pypi.org/project/wordle-python/) and [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to make a [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game instance with an auto-genarated word.


### !!!IMPORTANT!!!

As of current state, only run [wordle.bat](https://github.com/kailando/wordle/blob/master/wordle.bat) or the [Raw version of wordle.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kailando/wordle/master/wordle.bat).
You are only allowed to run the [bare-bones python file of wordle](https://github.com/kailando/wordle/blob/master/wordle.py) if you have PIP (not needed if you find another way of getting wordle-python), wordle-python, and Python itself.

## Notes
### Note 1
As of 7/31/2024, I am happy to let you know that **you do no longer need wordle-python**.
Instead, you need **termcolor**.
